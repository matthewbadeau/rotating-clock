rotating-clock
==============

A 3 tiered rotating clock that uses javascript intervals and css3 transforms.

I just thought about how a clock like this would work the other day, so I decided to whip up some code real quick. This is definitely not as efficient as the standard moving hands style of clock, but I find it interesting that the dials rotate counter clockwise since the single hand doesn't rotate.
